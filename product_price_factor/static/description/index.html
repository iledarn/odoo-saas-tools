             Odoo product model by it self has not ability to scale price different ways except of simple adding. 
             This module adds ability to scale product price by multiplying it. 
             For example if you need to sale some web service for hundred of user for two months you will be 
             forced to create different product positions for same item. But using this module you can just multiply price the way you want.

            <p>First of all enter in debug mode and mark "Manage product variants" checkbox in your user settings.</p>
                <img class="oe_picture oe_screenshot" src="1.png"/>
            <p>Then open some product and add "Attribute" and "Attribute values". Important thing that here you sets up sequence of coefficents apply. In this example subscribtion period coefficient applyed first and users amount coefficient is second.</p>    
            	<img class="oe_picture oe_screenshot" src="2.png"/>
            <p>Then you will see "Variant Prices" button. Press it. </p>    
            	<img class="oe_picture oe_screenshot" src="3.png"/>
            <p>You got to fill this table according to your needs. Attribute price factor is multiplier. Attribute price extra - as usual is adder. In this example logic is like that: we sale SaaS Service for 10$ for one month for 1-3 users. So we put x1 multiplier for line with 1-3 users and left 0 in adder field. Same actions for one month line. That mean we do not have special condition for 1-3 users and one month. Then if client whant to purchaise servise for 4-6 users then multiplier is 2. And so on.</p>    
            	<img class="oe_picture oe_screenshot" src="4.png"/>
            <p>Create new sale order and add items like in screenshot below. Here you can see how attributes multiplication and addition works. For example quarter of service for 4-6 users calculating like that: (10+18)*2=56. Basic price plus month extra multiplied on amount of users. Look up next line. If you increase amount you just doubles you total.</p>
